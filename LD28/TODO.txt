TODO List:
 - Fix the text box not dissapearing
 - Add some basic level generation (and collision [just check for blocks or something])
 - Add random task generation and add a timer (maybe use JMonkey timer)
 - Implement more of the textures when the task generation is being done
 - Maybe make new levels for the different tasks that are going to be done
 - Make some new classes and move code around for easability and compactness
